# Verilog to Turing Complete Save Converter

This is a tool that converts Verilog HDL code into save files for the game [Turing Complete](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/).

It utilizes **Yosys** to synthesize Verilog code into a netlist, and uses **ELK (Eclipse Layout Kernel)** algorithms to automatically layout components on the game canvas, finally generating a `.tcsav` save file that the game can read directly. This allows you to write Verilog in a professional IDE and then import it into the game for simulation or integration.

## Core Features

*   **Verilog Support**: Powered by the robust open-source synthesis tool [Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/), supporting standard Verilog syntax.
*   **Automatic Layout**: Uses ELK algorithms to automatically calculate component coordinates and wire routing, eliminating the need for manual placement.
*   **Component Mapping**: Automatically maps synthesized logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.) and complex components (Adders, Multiplexers, etc.) to their corresponding in-game components.
*   **Input/Output Handling**: Automatically identifies Verilog module I/O ports and generates the corresponding port components in the game.

## Installation

This project is built with Node.js. Please ensure you have Node.js installed (v18+ recommended).

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd verilog2tc/js
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the project**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Usage

After compiling, you can perform conversions using the command-line tool `verilog2tc` (located at `dist/cli.js`).

### Basic Command

```bash
node dist/cli.js --top <top_module_name> <input_file.v> <output_file.tcsav>
```

*   `--top <top_module_name>`: The name of the top-level module in the Verilog file (required).
*   `<input_file.v>`: Path to the source Verilog file.
*   `<output_file.tcsav>`: Path for the generated save file.

### Example

Suppose you have a file named `counter.v` with a top-level module named `counter_8bit`:

```bash
node dist/cli.js --top counter_8bit counter.v counter_save.tcsav
```

Once `counter_save.tcsav` is generated, you can load it directly in Turing Complete.

## Development

Project structure:

*   `src/pipeline/`: Core conversion flow control.
*   `src/yosys/`: Yosys WASM interface and executor, handling Verilog -> JSON netlist.
*   `src/netlist/`: Netlist adapter, processing data structures output by Yosys.
*   `src/layout/`: Layout engine interface, calling `elkjs` for coordinate calculation.
*   `src/tc/`: Game save format (.tcsav) reader/writer and component definitions.

### Common Commands

*   `npm run build`: Compile TypeScript code to `dist/` directory.
*   `npm run lint`: Run ESLint for code style checking.
*   `npm test`: Run Vitest test suite.

## How it Works

1.  **Synthesis**: Calls `@yowasp/yosys` to synthesize Verilog code into a logical netlist.
2.  **Translation**: Parses the JSON netlist generated by Yosys, converts it into a graph data structure, and matches internal game component IDs.
3.  **Layout**: Sends the graph data to `elkjs` to calculate optimal positions and routing for each node (component) and edge (wire).
4.  **Serialization**: Writes the layout results into the binary format, compresses with snappy, and generates the `.tcsav` file.
